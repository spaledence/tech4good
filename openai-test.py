Every time I drive up to campus for work, I almost have to pinch myself because it is hard to believe this is the place that I'm employed. I'm filled with gratitude for the wide open, rolling fields and beautiful redwoods surrounding the quaint buildings. It's the breathtaking view of the ocean and the gorgeous landscape that I'm grateful for mostly. Beyond that, there is plenty to be grateful about among my friendly and super helpful coworkers." }
